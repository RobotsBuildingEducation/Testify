After the recent failures of FTX along with the tech recession, I figured it would be good to review the fundamentals, since it seems that most people move on from the fundamentals too quickly during speculative markets. To keep it brief, I started learning about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency sometime around 2015 when I was studying operating systems in school. It just made sense to me as a digital native. Today, I work as an engineer at a financial technology company that’s focused on embedded finance and open-banking.

I’m going to keep things pretty simple and in plain language so that more people can understand, but at the end of the day it’s really not that complicated. The hard part is trying to understand what information is actually worthwhile, productive, truthful and creative. If you want to skip ahead and do your own research, I recommend to follow and study these organizations in order:

Bank Secrecy Act
The US Drug War
Bitcoin
AMD Xilinx
Block (Cash App’s parent company)
Bluesky
IPFS
USDC
Dogecoin
Cloudflare

Anyway the Proof of Work system that governs Bitcoin is pretty easy to illustrate. Machines use energy to perform work. Bitcoin takes it one step further and assigns an economic value to that relationship. So why does that matter? Well the reality is that technology is going to continue to advance, grow and automate things we once did. Productivity will go up and the nature of work will change. This has already happened. We aren’t used to assigning salary to the work performed by an AI algorithm or the work done by a robot but we eventually will.

So Bitcoin creates a relationship out of what happens when machines physically do work and the salary created out of it. To review, machines are using tiny pieces of chemicals and metals to create all the stuff that we see on the internet. So our shared digital space, when you really think about it, is still very physical. It burns energy and consumes oil no different than a car engine or a factory plant. In a nutshell, as machines and networks improve, so will Bitcoin. Many people appreciate that simplicity.

Proof of Stake, on the other hand, depends on people’s contribution and participation in the system. It depends on adoption. I’m not going to say that Proof of Stake is inherently bad or wrong, but it comes with risks that people seem to ignore. Proof of Stake depends on being able to trust others when participating in the system. It can lead to successful inventions or foolish failures. We can appreciate this truth when looking at fiat systems, governed by reserves, ordered by governments and informed by other structural conditions of society that have us participate in various economic and market systems.

In my view, Bitcoin and its influence over the market is far more compelling from an innovative and social perspective. It has a wonderful forward path in the ability to create a future economy that’s informed by automation, productivity and intelligent computing. From a political perspective, this seems to be related to our inevitable considerations of universal basic income.

From a cultural perspective, Bitcoin seems to endorse security, privacy and a more fair internet. A more fair space. This has resulted in the development of projects that allow users to navigate between social services. For example, if I were to get banned from TikTok, I would not lose my following and could use a service on Twitter instead to reach my audience. If I wanted to buy a service or item, I don’t have to go through several layers of applications to create that exchange. I would be able to receive Venmo transactions from my Cash App. It’s digital cash. It's a way where I can represent my identity in the digital space without state-sanctioned verifiers and credentialers. Bitcoin doesn’t seek to convince others to join it. It convinces engineers to rethink and expand services that already exist.

So here’s the issue with crypto, media, influence and the market. It’s often a victim of stakeholder capitalism. I think Charlie Munger illustrated it best: 

> “Big-shot businessmen get into these waves of social proof.  Do you remember some years ago when one oil company bought a fertilizer company, and every other major oil company practically ran out and bought a fertilizer company?  And there was no damned reason for all these oil companies to buy fertilizer companies, but they didn’t know exactly what to do, and if Exxon was doing it, it was good enough for Mobil, and vice versa.  I think they’re all gone now, but it was a total disaster.”

So that’s the same reason why, despite being an expert, most people would dismiss my idea that Dogecoin has more economic value than 99.9% of cryptocurrencies. It’s the reason why something like an NFT can be suddenly compelling and earth-shaking rather than just a modest feature for already existing services. Dogecoin is a simple proof-of-work system that was born out of an idea that tried to improve Bitcoin. Its reputation is loved and respected. Its social recognition is far greater than even that of Ethereum. If you were to ask a young individual today which coin they liked the most, without considering the possibility of profit or “winning the crypto game”, I would wager most people would elect Dogecoin.

But unfortunately, stakeholder capitalism is a game of bias, trust and relationships. We will be focusing on that economic reality in this writing often, and you’ll often see me disregard financial statements or other regurgitated content in financial media. This is about understanding what drives real innovation and impact in the market.

So why are engineers and innovators so interested in Bitcoin or these blockchains in the first place? How does it relate to Jay Z? One ought to consider the context of Black American history and the consequence of systemic oppression that muddies much of American history. Much deeper conversations can be read in books like “The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration In The Age Of Colorblindness” and “Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools For The New Jim Code”. However in our case, we can observe the history of the policies that govern the financial technology industry.

The financial technology industry is largely an extension of the banking sector. It must follow so-called regulations revolving around anti-money laundering and financial crimes. I’m not here to write about the political currency of this implementation, but its origin is in 1970, two years after the Civil Rights Act and one year prior to the launch of the Drug War. What I’m trying to say here is that it’s not much of a coincidence why Bitcoin or cryptocurrency became an element of international drug trade in places like the Silk Road or Dark Web.

It’s also not a coincidence why folks like Charlie Munger are not fond of the system. According to investors like Charlie Munger, these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime. But what this also means is that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first that must essentially verify that you aren't an undocumented immigrant, a drug trading criminal, or a terrorist. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, access to loans, and other means of securing wealth which is exactly where banks fall into institutional oppression. They're systems we are either unaware of or numb to - but they are wrong. They are unfair and unjust. Frankly, Charlie Munger could never be someone like Jay Z either.

And this history matters so much. It explains why gangster rap was created. It explains today’s connection of hip-hop to our history of colonization and slavery. It defines our attitudes, culture and perception of our space. One might think it’s a stretch, but you couldn’t log onto a platform like Tiktok today and livestream with cannabis present. Machine learning algorithms would detect it and temporarily suspend you from streaming. It also informs the economic reality that recently trusted cannabis shops will be built with Square websites, using Square payment systems, with customers using their Cash Apps and Cash Cards so that they can exchange cannabis legally in the financial technology network. One could appreciate how Cash App allows for an alternative payment system where users don’t agree to inform machine learning algorithms about their transactions. There is no all-seeing eye to examine what I transacted. When examining the industry critically, you can see how these artificially intelligent machines become statistically more strict with names impacted by these anti money laundering acts. As history rhymes, it impacts Black, Latino and Middle Eastern lives and bodies.

So in short, Sam Bankman-Fried and Charlie Munger could never be Jay Z, because neither of them are Black. If Silicon Valley understood that, the industry would steer back in the right direction. If we could take a moment to reflect, we ought to consider amending the past before marching toward the future.
